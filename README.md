## Nanoindentation stress-strain analysis 
This Jupyter notebook performs an analysis on mechanical data to study brittle fracture behavior. It leverages the relationship between strain and stress, focusing on the identification of significant peaks in the stress-strain curve. The notebook uses Python libraries such as matplotlib, scipy, and numpy to process the data and visualize the results.

## Features
Feature Identification: Identifies prominent peaks in the stress-strain data, including yung modulus, yield strength, ultimate strength, and point of fracture. 
Graph Generation: Plots the stress-strain curve and highlights the identified peaks.
Data Saving: For each graph, the notebook saves a csv file with all the feature data.
